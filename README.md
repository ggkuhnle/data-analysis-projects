# 📦 Data Analysis Toolkit for Food and Nutritional Sciences

This repository contains a modular collection of Jupyter/Colab notebooks designed to support data literacy, programming, and analysis skills for students in Food and Nutritional Sciences.

All notebooks are **self-contained** and intended for **pick-and-mix use**, meaning students and staff can dip in and out based on current teaching or learning needs.

## 🗂️ Structure

## 🚀 How to Use

Each notebook includes a **Colab badge** for one-click execution.

Topics can be used in standalone form or aligned with modules in the FNS curriculum. The structure supports both scaffolded use across multiple years and ad hoc support based on student interest or need.
