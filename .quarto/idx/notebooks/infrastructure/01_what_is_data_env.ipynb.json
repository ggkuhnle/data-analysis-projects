In this notebook, we explore what a **data science environment** is ‚Äî and why setting up the right tools can make your work easier, cleaner, and more reproducible.\n\n\n\n\nA **data environment** is a combination of:\n\n- Software: Python, Jupyter, Excel, R\n- Tools: Notebooks, scripts, version control\n- Data: CSVs, spreadsheets, databases\n- Workflows: Reproducible steps, documented processes\n\nThink of it like your lab bench in a research lab. You need the right tools, a clean space, and a way to document what you've done.\n\n\n### Why this matters\n\nIf you use Excel and manually delete a row or overwrite a number, the change is *gone*. There is no record of it unless you create backup files (e.g. `final_final_02.xlsx` üôÉ).\n\nWith Python, your steps are scripted. Anyone (including future-you) can run the same script and get the same output.\n\n\nThis script tells you **what** was done ‚Äî filtering animals above 1000 kg ‚Äî and you can re-run it whenever needed.\n\nIt also produces the same result each time, unlike an unlogged Excel edit.\n\n\n## üîç Advanced View\n\n<details><summary>Click to expand advanced concepts</summary>\n\n### IDEs and Notebooks\n\n- **IDE** = Integrated Development Environment (e.g. VS Code, PyCharm)\n- **Notebook** = An interactive document with code + output + explanation (like this one)\n\n### Environments\n\n- Use `venv` or `conda` to create clean environments\n- Avoid package conflicts and make your analysis portable\n\n### Versioning and Reproducibility\n\n- Use Git to track changes to code and notebooks\n- Document your workflow with Quarto or Markdown\n\n</details>\n\n\n## üß™ Exercises\n\n1.
