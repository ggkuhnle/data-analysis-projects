# 📦 Data Analysis Toolkit for Food and Nutritional Sciences

Welcome to the *Data Analysis Toolkit for FNS*!  
This repository provides a modular, self-guided, and teaching-aligned collection of Python-based notebooks and resources to build data literacy and analysis skills.

Each section contains standalone, hands-on notebooks that can be explored independently or aligned with module content across Years 1–3.
