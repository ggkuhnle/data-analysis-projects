    "### Learning Objectives\n",

    "- Map out the endâ€‘toâ€‘end steps from raw inputs to aggregated summaries  \n",

    "- **`clinical_trial_data.xlsx`**: Simulated dietary intervention results from a randomized trial  \n",
    "- **Local SQLite database (`fns_db.sqlite`)**: Consolidated tables for nutrient reference values and cohort metadata  \n",

    "3. **3.3 Data Cleaning & Quality Checks**: Handle missing values and inconsistent measurements.  \n",
    "4. **3.4 Reshaping & Merging Datasets**: Tame wide and long data, and join multiple tables.  \n",
    "5. **3.5 Transformation & Feature Engineering**: Create new variables like flavanol ratios.  \n",
    "6. **3.6 Aggregation & Summarization**: Summarise intake by cohort and export results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Ready to get your feet wet? Letâ€™s dive into 3.1 next â€” may your code be ever crash-free and your data as tidy as a basking hippo!"
