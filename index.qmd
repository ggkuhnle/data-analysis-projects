# 📦 Data Analysis Toolkit for Food and Nutritional Sciences

Welcome to the **Data Analysis Toolkit**, a modular resource designed for undergraduate and postgraduate students in **Food and Nutritional Sciences** (FNS). This site supports both structured teaching and self-guided exploration, combining Python programming with practical applications in nutrition, food science, public health, and more.

## 📚 Course Structure

Each section builds progressively in depth and complexity — but you can dip into any topic independently.

### 🔧 [Foundations and Tools](notebooks/infrastructure/index.qmd)
> Set up your coding environment and learn how to work reproducibly.

- Data science environments (local, cloud)
- Google Colab, Jupyter, and VS Code
- Git, GitHub, version control
- Python packages and dependencies
- Markdown, scripts, and Quarto

### 🧱 [Programming Basics](notebooks/programming_basics/index.qmd)
> Learn Python from scratch, with examples grounded in real-world data.

- Syntax, variables, loops, and functions
- Data types and coding style
- Object-oriented programming (with hippos!)
- Documentation and basic automation

### 🧮 [Data Handling](notebooks/data_handling/index.qmd)
> Clean, reshape, and prepare real data for analysis.

- Importing from CSV, Excel, APIs
- Handling missing data, outliers, recoding
- Filtering, grouping, joining datasets
- Tidy data, wide vs long format
- “Clean this mess!” challenge

### 📊 [Data Analysis](notebooks/data_analysis/index.qmd)
> Run and interpret statistical tests and models — with visual output.

- Distributions, transformations, categorical encoding
- Parametric and non-parametric tests
- Bayesian vs Frequentist approaches
- Regression, survival analysis, and power calculations
- Visualising results: boxplots, violin, forest plots

### 🚀 [Advanced Techniques](notebooks/advanced/index.qmd)
> For curious students and power users.

- Bayesian modelling with PyMC
- Workflow automation and CI
- SQL, SQLite, and cloud databases (e.g. Snowflake)
- Large-scale exploratory analysis (e.g. EFSA datasets)
- Streamlit dashboards, PCA, and image analysis

### 📋 [Qualitative Methods](notebooks/qualitative/index.qmd)
> Explore text-based and thematic data analysis.

- Interviews, coding, and focus groups
- Thematic and sentiment analysis
- Taguette, NVivo, and Python text processing

### 🧪 [Projects and Templates](notebooks/projects/index.qmd)
> Apply your skills to mini-projects or your dissertation.

- Ready-to-use project templates
- Guided assignments with real data
- Dashboard creation, epidemiological comparisons, survey coding
