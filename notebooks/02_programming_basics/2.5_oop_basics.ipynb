    "# üßë‚Äçüíª 2.5 Object-Oriented Programming Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, tailored for food and nutrition science students. OOP is a powerful way to organise code, making it more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain‚Äîperfect for managing complex nutrition data projects!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives**:\n",
    "- Understand key OOP concepts: classes, objects, methods, and inheritance.\n",
    "- Apply OOP to model nutrition-related concepts (e.g., foods, diets).\n",
    "- Practise creating and using classes to solve simple problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context**: In nutrition research, you often deal with related data (e.g., foods, nutrients, diets). OOP lets you model these as objects with properties (e.g., calories) and behaviours (e.g., calculate energy), making your code more intuitive and scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "<details><summary>Fun Fact</summary>\n",
    "Think of OOP like a hippo‚Äôs diet plan‚Äîeach food item is an object, and the diet is a class that organises them! ü¶õ\n",

    "1. **Create a New Class**: Create a `Nutrient` class with attributes for `name` (e.g., 'Protein') and `amount` (e.g., 10 grams). Add a method `increase_amount` that increases the amount by a given factor. Test it by creating a `Nutrient` object for 'Vitamin C' with 90 mg and increasing it by 1.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Extend the Diet Class**: Add a method to the `Diet` class called `is_low_calorie` that returns `True` if the food has fewer than 100 calories, `False` otherwise. Test it with `keto_avocado` and a new low-calorie diet food (e.g., 'Spinach', 23 calories, 'Vegetable', 'Low-Carb').\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inheritance Challenge**: Create a `Meal` class that inherits from `Diet` and has an additional attribute `meal_type` (e.g., 'Breakfast'). Override the `describe` method to include the meal type. Create a `Meal` object and test it.\n",

    "**Guidance**: Use the examples above as a starting point. Experiment with different foods and diets relevant to nutrition science!"
